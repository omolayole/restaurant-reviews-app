# Restaurant Reviews App Project Overview: Stage 1

Convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.

### Specification

You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### Task To Be Done

1. Make the site to be responsive on different sized displays.
2. Make the site accessible for screen reader use. 
3. Add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### How to Run the website
1. Clone the project and unzip the file.
2. cd into the directory you want the cloned directory to be.
3. Use Python to launch a local client server. You need Python installed. If needed, download it from Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) and complete installation. From inside the new directory, launch a local client server using Python from your terminal: * Python 2: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 * Python 3: python3 -m http.server 8000. Leave the terminal open.
4. Visit the site in your browser at http://localhost:8000

### Dependencies

This project uses [Leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/), a JavaScript library for embedding maps, and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), an open-source mapping platform that is free to use.
